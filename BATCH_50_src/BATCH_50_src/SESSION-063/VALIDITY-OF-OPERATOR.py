LHS = RHS

variable_name = expression

expression:
    Valid combination of operators and operands is an expression.

    Basis for validity?
        1) Ary of operator
        2) Prefix/Infix/Postfix
        3) Relative Precedence
        4) Associativity

L[i:j:k]

L -> Operand
i, j, k -> Operand

SUBSCRIPT
    UNARY POSTFIX OPERATOR

    ITS LEFT ASSOCIATIVE

    PRECEDENCE IS GREATER THAN ASSIGNMENT

    L1 = L[i:j:k]
