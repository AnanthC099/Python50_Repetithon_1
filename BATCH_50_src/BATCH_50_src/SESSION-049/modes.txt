open(file_path, mode)

1) IF mode == 'w' 
    If the file to be opened is not present on the disk then it will be created 
    and then it will be opened for the writing purpose. 

    CREATED DETAILS: 
        file_path = absolute or relative 
        EVENTUALLY IT WILL BE CONVERTED INTO AN ABSOLUTE PATH 

        ABSOLUTE PATH = DIRNAME + BASE-NAME 

        If mode is write and ALL PATH NAME COMPONENTS IN DIR NAME 
        ARE PRESENT AND ONLY BASE-NAME IS NOT PRESENT IN DIR NAME 
        THEN IT WILL BE CREATED. 

        open('abc.txt', 'w')

        abc.txt -> relative path name 

        convert it into absolute path 

        C:\Users\CPA\Docuemnts\CLASS\SESSION-049\abc.txt

        BASENAME(DIRNAME(C:\Users\CPA\Docuemnts\CLASS\SESSION-049\abc.txt))
        ==
        BASENAME(C:\Users\CPA\Docuemnts\CLASS\SESSION-049)
        ==
        SESSION-049

    If the file represented by path name is present THEN 
    THE FILE WILL TRUNCATED (= ITS EXISTING CONTENTS WILL BE DELETED)
    And then it will be opened for writing
