This is a text file. 
I am going to write some random content in it. 
Python's type system is dynamic and inferred in nature. 
Variable names do not have types in Python. 

Following are the built in data types in Python: 
    1)      Boolean 
    2)      Integer 
    3)      Float
    4)      String 
    5)      List 
    6)      Tuple 
    7)      Dictionary 
    8)      Set
