Below is your **entire code**, grouped into logical blocks, with the **concept** behind each block. **All lines are covered.**

---

## 1) Function definition: “Find all occurrences of an element in a list”

**Concept:** We write a reusable function that returns a list of indices where a given `element` appears in list `L`.

```python
def find_all_occurrences(L: list, element: any) -> list[int]:
```

* **Concept:** Function header

  * `L: list` → input list
  * `element: any` → value to search (can be any type)
  * `-> list[int]` → function returns a list of integer indices

```python
    index_list = []
```

* **Concept:** Output accumulator
  Stores all found indices.

```python
    start_index = 0
```

* **Concept:** “Search-from” pointer
  Tells `index()` where to start searching next.

```python
    current_index = 0
```

* **Concept:** Temporary variable
  Holds the latest found index before we store it.

---

## 2) Loop to keep searching until the element is no longer found

**Concept:** Keep finding the next occurrence, store its index, then move forward.

```python
    while element in L[start_index : len(L)]:
```

* **Concept:** Membership test on a slice (sub-list)

  * `L[start_index : len(L)]` → remaining portion of the list
  * `element in ...` → checks if element is still present ahead
  * Loop continues until no more occurrences exist.

```python
        current_index = L.index(element, start_index)
```

* **Concept:** Locate next occurrence
  `L.index(element, start_index)` returns the first index of `element` starting from `start_index`.

```python
        index_list.append(current_index)
```

* **Concept:** Store result
  Save the found index into the list.

```python
        start_index = current_index + 1
```

* **Concept:** Move search window forward
  Next search begins after the current match, preventing infinite repeat of the same index.

```python
    return index_list
```

* **Concept:** Final output
  Return the list of all indices.

## 3) Input data setup

**Concept:** A list with repeated values (10, 20, 30, etc.), used for testing.

```python
L = [10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 40, 20, 10, 30, 50, 60, 30, 20, 40]
```

---

## 4) Calling the function for different elements

**Concept:** Reuse the same function for multiple search values.

```python
all_indices_20 = find_all_occurrences(L, 20)
all_indices_10 = find_all_occurrences(L, 10)
all_indices_30 = find_all_occurrences(L, 30)
all_indices_40 = find_all_occurrences(L, 40)
all_indices_50 = find_all_occurrences(L, 50)
all_indices_60 = find_all_occurrences(L, 60)
```

* **Concept:** Function reuse + storing results
  Each variable stores all indices where that value occurs.

---

## 5) Printing the list with indices (manual indexing loop)

**Concept:** Use a `while` loop to print each index and its value.

```python
i = 0
```

* **Concept:** Loop counter initialization

```python
while i < len(L):
```

* **Concept:** Loop condition
  Runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(L)-1`.

```python
    print(i, L[i], sep='\t')
```

* **Concept:** Indexing + formatted output

  * `L[i]` → element at index `i`
  * `sep='\t'` → prints index and value separated by a tab

```python
    i = i + 1 
```

* **Concept:** Counter increment
  Moves to next index.

---

## 6) Printing the final computed results

**Concept:** Display all occurrences (index lists) collected earlier.

```python
print('All indices for data value 10:', all_indices_10)
print('All indices for data value 20:', all_indices_20)
print('All indices for data value 30:', all_indices_30)
print('All indices for data value 40:', all_indices_40)
print('All indices for data value 50:', all_indices_50)
print('All indices for data value 60:', all_indices_60)
```

* **Concept:** Result reporting
  Shows which indices each data value appears at.

### What this program demonstrates (in one line)

**Concept summary:** *“Use `index(value, start)` repeatedly with a moving start position to collect all matching indices.”*
