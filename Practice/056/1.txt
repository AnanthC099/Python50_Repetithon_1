Below is your **entire IDLE session**, grouped properly with the **concepts**, and **every line covered**.

---

## 1) Tuple unpacking (positional assignment)

**Concept:** *Tuple positional assignment / unpacking*
Rule: **Number of variables on LHS must match number of values on RHS**.

```py
>>> (a, b, c) = (10, 20, 30) # tuple positional assignment
>>> a
10
>>> b
20
 
>>> c
30
```

**What happened here:**

* RHS tuple `(10, 20, 30)` has **3 values**
* LHS `(a, b, c)` has **3 names**
* Values are assigned position-wise:

  * `a = 10`, `b = 20`, `c = 30`

---

## 2) List unpacking (positional assignment)

**Concept:** *List unpacking / destructuring*
Same unpacking rule: **count must match**.

```py
>>> [p, q, r] = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]
>>> p
1.1
>>> q
2.2
>>> r
3.3
```

**What happened here:**

* LHS has 3 variables: `p, q, r`
* RHS list has 3 values: `1.1, 2.2, 3.3`
* Assigned position-wise:

  * `p=1.1`, `q=2.2`, `r=3.3`

---

## 3) Multiple assignment using comma-separated values

**Concept:** *Multiple assignment / unpacking from an implicit tuple*
When you write `u, v, w = True, False, True`, Python treats RHS as a tuple.

```py
>>> u, v, w = True, False, True
>>> u
True
>>> v
False
>>> w
True
```

**What happened here:**

* LHS has 3 variables
* RHS has 3 values
* Works fine:

  * `u=True`, `v=False`, `w=True`

---

## 4) Unpacking error: too many values (LHS smaller than RHS)

**Concept:** *Unpacking must match exactly → otherwise ValueError*
Case: RHS has **more** values than LHS variables.

```py
>>> u, v, w = 10, 20, 30, 40
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#12>", line 1, in <module>
    u, v, w = 10, 20, 30, 40
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3, got 4)
```

**Meaning:**

* LHS expects **3** values (`u, v, w`)
* RHS provides **4** values (`10, 20, 30, 40`)
* So Python raises:

  * `expected 3, got 4`

---

## 5) Unpacking error: too many values (again)

**Concept:** *Same error type, different counts*

```py
>>> u, v = 10, 20, 30
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#13>", line 1, in <module>
    u, v = 10, 20, 30
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2, got 3)
```

**Meaning:**

* LHS expects **2** values (`u, v`)
* RHS provides **3** values (`10, 20, 30`)
* Error:

  * `expected 2, got 3`

---

## 6) Unpacking error: not enough values (LHS bigger than RHS)

**Concept:** *RHS has fewer values than LHS expects → ValueError*
Case: LHS variables are **more** than RHS values.

```py
>>> u, v, w, s = 10, 20
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#14>", line 1, in <module>
    u, v, w, s = 10, 20
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 2)
```

**Meaning:**

* LHS expects **4** values (`u, v, w, s`)
* RHS provides only **2** (`10, 20`)
* Error:

  * `expected 4, got 2`

---

### Core rule summary (the single key concept behind all lines)

**Unpacking / positional assignment rule:**

* **LHS count must match RHS count**, unless you use a starred target like `*rest` (not used in your code).

If you want, I can extend this same note with the **star-unpacking fix** examples (like `u, v, *rest = 10, 20, 30, 40`).
